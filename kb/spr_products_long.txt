 {'Product Name': 'Quality Management',
  'Long summary': 'Quality Management is a powerful tool that helps contact centers deliver excellent customer experiences and improve agent performance. It does this by analyzing all customer interactions, both digital and voice, and providing quality managers and supervisors with AI-driven agent quality and compliance scores. This means that every conversation is analyzed in real-time, and data is unified across all channels to create a single source of truth for contact center metrics. Prior to the introduction of AI-driven Quality Management solutions, quality management was often a manual process that relied heavily on human judgement. Quality managers and supervisors would listen to recordings of customer interactions, score them based on predetermined criteria, and provide feedback to agents. While this approach was effective to a certain extent, it was time-consuming, labor-intensive, and lacked the accuracy and consistency provided by AI-driven solutions. With Automated Quality Management, quality managers and supervisors can track agent performance, identify coaching opportunities, and uncover business drivers for leadership. The solution enables efficient quality management by providing visibility into 100% of conversations and leveraging AI to provide insights into what makes or breaks CX. This means that contact centers can identify key areas of improvement, likely escalation points, and coaching opportunities for each agent using AI. One of the key benefits of Quality Management is that it enables contact centers to move towards a proactive care model. By identifying gaps in processes and performance in real-time, contact centers can take proactive steps to address issues before they become major problems. This not only improves the customer experience but also helps contact centers mitigate compliance risk.'},
